Recently, the expert finding problem attracted much attention in information retrieval research. In this work, we inspect the feasibility of supervised learning model to identify data science experts in Reddit. Our method is based on the manual coding results where two data science experts labelled expert, non-expert and out-of-scope comments. We present a semi-supervised approach using the activity behaviour of every user, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), crowdsourced and user feature sets. We conclude that the NLP and user feature sets contribute the most to the better identification of these three classes It means that this method can generalise well within the domain. Moreover, we present different types of users, which can be helpful to detect various types of users in the future.","tags":[],"title":"Identifying Experts in Question \u0026 Answer Portals: A Case Study on Data Science Competencies in Reddit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","José A.

The authors explored online portals that can provide evidence of evaluating, inferring, measuring skills, and/or contributing to the development of competencies and capabilities of the 21st century with two case studies. The first one is focused on identifying data science topical experts across the Reddit community. The second one uses online Flickr data to apply a model on the photographs to rate them as aesthetically attractive and technically sound, which can serve as a base for measuring the photography capabilities of Flickr users. The presented results can serve as a base to replicate these methodologies to infer other competencies and capabilities across online portals. This novel approach can be an effective alternative evaluation of key 21st century skills for the modern workforce with multiple applications.","tags":[],"title":"Using Online Digital Data to Infer Valuable Skills for the Modern Workforce","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","Sergei Gleyzer","Patrick Peplowski","Giorgos Pipilis","Jason Terry"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"31f03df0e520a508fb7132a204b5b709","permalink":"https://strukovas.gitub.io/publication/lpsc_2022/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lpsc_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Albedo Anomalies on the Lunar Surface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","José A.

In this context, teachers intend to optimise the process of learning and make it more dynamic and exciting by introducing gamification. Thus, this paper focuses on a data-driven assessment of geometry competencies, which are essential for developing problem-solving and higher-order thinking skills. We explored them in the domain of knowledge inference, whose primary goal is to predict or measure the students' knowledge over questions as they interact with a learning platform at a specific time. Hence, the main goal of the current paper is to compare several well-known algorithms applied to the data of a geometry game named Shadowspect in order to predict students' performance in terms of classifier metrics such as Area Under Curve (AUC), accuracy, and F1 score. We found Elo to be the algorithm with the best prediction power. However, the rest of the algorithms also showed decent results, and, therefore, we can conclude that all the algorithms hold the potential to measure and estimate the actual knowledge of students. In turn, this means that they can be applied in formal education to improve teaching, learning, organisational efficiency and, as a consequence, this can serve as a basement for a change in the system.","tags":[],"title":"Data-Driven Performance Prediction in a Geometry Game Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mariano Albaladejo-González","Sofia Strukova","José A.

In this sense, educational technology environments can help to generate more immersive and realistic environments, and within this context, cyber range systems are one of the foremost solutions. However, these systems might not provide rich and detailed feedback to instructors and students regarding the performance in each cyberexercise. In this paper we discuss the potential of multimodal data, including clickstream, console commands, biometrics, and other sensor data, to improve the feedback and evaluation process in cyber range environments. We present the affordances that these techniques can bring to cybersecurity training as well as a preliminary architecture to implement them. We argue that these technologies can become a new generation of high-quality, realistic, and adaptive cybersecurity training that can have a dual (civil and military) impact on our society","tags":[],"title":"Exploring the Affordances of Multimodal Data to Improve Cybersecurity Training with Cyber Range Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
