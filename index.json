Traditional methods often fail to capture the complexity and diversity of modern competencies, necessitating the development of new frameworks that can adapt to diverse contexts and data sources. This chapter introduces a comprehensive, data-driven framework designed to assess skills across various digital environments. The framework is designed to be flexible and scalable, capable of integrating a wide range of data types and analytical techniques to provide a nuanced evaluation of competencies. The effectiveness of this framework was exemplified through case studies in distinct settings, each selected for their unique characteristics. This demonstrated the framework’s adaptability and robustness in evaluating and improving a broad spectrum of competencies. By providing a comprehensive method for assessing 21st-century skills, this chapter highlights the critical role of innovative, data-driven frameworks in accurately evaluating and enhancing the competencies essential for success in today’s rapidly changing world.","tags":[],"title":"A framework and case studies for data-driven computer-based diagnostics of competencies and capabilities across contexts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","María del Carmen Alcantud Juárez","Panteleone Nespoli","José A.

The study begins by preprocessing data and extracting both frequent and maximal command sequences using computer-based mining algorithms. By comparing these extracted patterns to expected solutions, the research uncovers areas where students struggle, such as inefficient tool usage and conceptual misunderstandings. These insights provide a deeper understanding of student behavior, helping instructors identify key areas for improvement in their teaching strategies. The chapter also explores the broader educational value of data mining in cybersecurity trainings by demonstrating its applicability in identifying general knowledge gaps, adjusting lesson difficulty, and addressing specific instructional challenges. Future directions include enhancing the dataset with attributes such as real-time help requests and the development of a real-time visual interface to provide instructors with actionable insights.

In this work, we aim to provide a multidisciplinary exploration into the current educational landscape, focusing on the following pivotal areas - cyber defence educational initiatives, digital skills, technological enablers, and ethical considerations. First, we present the current landscape of cyber defence educational initiatives. Then, we examine the required digital skills, virtual reality and augmented reality initiatives for immersive learning experiences and delve into the advantages of game-based learning for skill acquisition in order to finally provide a holistic evaluation of the complexities involved in cyber defence training. We underscore the importance of standardising training modules tailored to diverse roles within cyber defence. The discussion emphasises the need for ethical and legal guidelines, especially concerning privacy and bias in AI-driven educational tools. Finally, we highlight the importance of dynamic curricula that include technical, legal, and soft skills, along with hands-on training through simulations to prepare operators for real-world cyber threats. This work will serve as a foundation for academics, industry professionals, and policy-makers interested in elevating the standards and effectiveness of cyber defence training suggesting ideas for more specialised, adaptable, and ethically responsible programs.","tags":[],"title":"Bridging the Gap: Cyber Defence Skills for the Future","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","Rubén Gaspar Marco","Félix Gómez Mármol","José A.

These sites have proved their ability to yield rich data sets through the users’ interaction which can be used to perform a data-driven evaluation of capabilities. Nevertheless, this study reveals the lack of suitable data sets in photo and video sharing platforms and evaluation processes across them. In this way, our first contribution is the creation of one of the largest labelled data sets in Flickr with the multimodal data which has been open sourced as part of this contribution. It incorporates multimodal data, combining information from various sources such as user profiles, photo metadata, and crowdsourced features. Predicated on these data, we explored machine learning models and concluded that it is feasible to properly predict whether a user is a professional photographer or not based on self-reported occupation labels and several feature representations out of the user, photo and crowdsourced sets. We also examined the relationship between the aesthetics and technical quality of a picture and the social activity of that picture. Finally, we depicted which characteristics differentiate professional photographers from non-professionals. As far as we know, the results presented in this work represent an important novelty for identifying expertise in the domain of photography, which researchers from various domains can utilise for related applications.","tags":[],"title":"Identifying Professional Photographers Through Image Quality and Aesthetics in Flickr","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","José A.

Our main goal is to adapt, evaluate and compare Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), Performance Factor Analysis (PFA), Elo and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) algorithms applied to the data of a geometry game named Shadowspect, in order to predict students’ performance by means of several classifier metrics. We analysed two algorithmic configurations, with and without prioritisation of Knowledge Components (KCs) – the skills needed to complete a puzzle successfully, and we found Elo to be the algorithm with the best prediction power with the ability to model the real knowledge of students. However, the best results are achieved without KCs because it is a challenging task to differentiate between KCs effectively in game environments. Our results prove that the above-mentioned algorithms can be applied in formal education to improve teaching, learning, and organisational efficiency.","tags":[],"title":"Adapting Knowledge Inference Algorithms to Measure Geometry Competencies through a Puzzle Game","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rubén Gaspar Marco","Sofia Strukova","José A.

In addition to the data collected directly from Flickr, we enriched the dataset with new features resulting from the automated analysis of the photos and their comments. One of the most valuable features of this data collection is that each photo has three Image Quality Assessment scores representing aesthetic and technical aspects. For this, we used Convolutional Neural Networks trained with human-labeled data.

From more than a decade, the expert finding problem attracted much attention in information retrieval research. Based on the encountered gaps in the expert identification across several Q \u0026 A portals, we inspect the feasibility of identifying data science experts in Reddit. Our method is based on the manual coding results where two data science experts labelled not only expert and non-expert comments, but also out-of-scope comments, which is a novel contribution to the literature, enabling the identification of more groups of comments across web portals. We present a semi-supervised approach which combines 1113 labelled comments with 100,226 unlabelled comments during training. We proved that it is possible to develop models that can identify expert, non-expert and out-of-scope comments peaking the AUC score at 0.93, accuracy at 0.83, MAE at 0.15 degrees and R2 score at 0.69. The proposed model uses the activity behaviour of every user, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), crowdsourced and user feature sets. We conclude that the NLP and user feature sets contribute the most to the better identification of these three classes. It means that this method can generalise well within the domain. Finally, we make a novel contribution by presenting different types of users in Reddit, which opens many future research directions.","tags":[],"title":"Computational approaches to detect experts in distributed online communities: a case study on Reddit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sofia Strukova","José A.
